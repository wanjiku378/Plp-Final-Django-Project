**Ecommerce Project**
Used django to create above project. The user is able to add item to cart, view the items in the cart and make purchase. Not just the register users but also the
anonymous user. Used JavaScript for frontend especially to get information of the anonymous user. Building this project has helped me have a profound understanding in django, I plan on adding more feature in this project, like having an admin page and also adding machine learning where by the all the activities of the user are monitored hence the website can recommend similar goods.
